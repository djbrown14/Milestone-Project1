Hannah's Resume (hb)

This is my website called 'hb' which are my initals. I chose to use lowercase for the name of the website as it looks smart and i am trying to come across as business. My website has four pages including the landing page. Each page gives the user some information about me and who i am. This project was intended for employers to look at and hopefully give me a job after looking through as seeing i am good at what i can do. This is here to help aspiring developers see what can be achieved when you work hard. My target audience is mainly employers or people looking for workers, I have added my cv and a rough resume to grab the attention of users and hopefully get my foot in the door with web development.

This website is for the purpose of getting my information out their for employers and employees to look at and hopefully lead me to gain a job within the web development industry. This website is for inspired individulas to see my website and let others know to hopefully land me a job. 

Features

In my website I have a home page where the user will be able to see me and the key information about me. At the top of the page there is a navigation bar which will take the user to the other pages. There is also a download cv and contact me page which will link to other pages if the user is too busy to look through the whole website. 
The next page in the navigation bar is the about page. This page will include a little information about me and who i am. There will be a skills section which shows the user my skills that i have. At the bottom of this page, there are the services that i can provide a employer who is looking to gain a employee. 
The third page is a portfolio page which shows some images of the projects which i have been involved with. The images are of different parts of a website to show of my skills as a well rounded web developer. 
My last page is all about my cv which is downloadable from the homepage as well as a contact me form which employers can leave me a message. 

Navigation Bar

Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Portfolio and Contact Me page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

The landing includes a photograph with text underneath to allow the user to see exactly who i am and my key information. This key information is my name, job title, email and phone number. At the bottom of this page there is a downloadable cv if the user would would like to look further. There is a link to the contact form as well to make it quick for the user if busy.
This section introduces the user to me and shows them who i am.

This page will allow the user to contact me and be directed to a new page where there will be a message saying 'i will get back shortly'. The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address and a message.

Features Left to Implement
Download cv and contact me unable to seperate them
I wanted to have the download cv on left and contact me on the right side of the home page but i didnt have enough time to fix this problem.

Links to resume and contact information
I did not have enough time to add the links that would take the user from the home page to the contact page.

General layout with larger screens
I was unable to get the contact section and the resume side by side when viewing on a larger device for better use.

My services table looks unappealing
I ran out to time to be able to give my services table a better style. My aim was just to get the information out on the page.

Contact page submit
I have not been able to reate a secondary page for the viewer to see once they submit in the contact section.

Testing

I have made my website pleasing to the eye on both mobile and desktop. I have used media queries to change the layout of my website which is pleasing to the eyes. In the portfolio section i have increased the image columns to give the user a better experience. 

Some of my images are not loading every time the website is lauched but unsure if this is due to my internet speed. Download cv and contact me is sitting above each other whether as i would of liked them on either side of the page to make it look more peasing to the viewer.

Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
