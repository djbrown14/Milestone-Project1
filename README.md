Hannah's Resume (hb)

This is my website called 'hb' which are my initals. I chose to use lowercase for the name of the website as it looks smart and i am trying to come across as business. My website has four pages including the landing page. Each page gives the user some information about me and who i am. This project was intended for employers to look at and hopefully give me a job after looking through as seeing i am good at what i can do.

Other General Project Advice
Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work!

One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through this article by Chris Beams on How to Write a Git Commit Message

Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood
When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.

For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept.
